Two principal aspects = client and server
    -Client starts the communication
    -Server will give the data
   NOTE: have to run the server for the connection between client-server


INTERNET
    Identify the machine i want to be connected
    Every computer has one or more Interphases each one with IP address
    IP address can change depending on which computer you are connected, you send messages and they will arrive


-example- the IP address of my phone at the university [12/02/2019]
    phone IP = 10.0.54.62
-example- getting the IP address of the computer. I enter to the terminal, write 'ifconfig',
the part that says 'enp0s31f6' search in there the 'inet' thats the IP address
    computer IP = 212.128.253.66
    teacher's IP = 212.128.253.64


To see if there is communication between the computer and final computer, I type in the terminal 'ping 8.8.8.8'
    ping time to 8.8.8.8 ---- time=3.53 ms
    ping time with my computer (using mi IP) ---- time=0.061 ms (61 us)
    ping time to a computer in the same network (using the specific IP of the comp) ---- time=0.613 ms (600us)
(obviously the time will depend on the distance)
    ping time with my phone ---- time=61.0 ms
    ping to www.google.com ---- 216.58.214.164
    ping to urjc.es ---- 192.168.46.46


PORT:
    The common port of web is 80
    TO CONNECTING TO THE SERVER: I need the IP address of the machine and the port number of the serverWRITE IS A TEXT EXAMPLE FOR ADDING TO MY FILEWRITE IS A TEXT EXAMPLE FOR ADDING TO MY FILEWRITE IS A TEXT EXAMPLE FOR ADDING TO MY FILEWRITE IS A TEXT EXAMPLE FOR ADDING TO MY FILEWRITE IS A TEXT EXAMPLE FOR ADDING TO MY FILEWRITE IS A TEXT EXAMPLE FOR ADDING TO MY FILEWRITE IS A TEXT EXAMPLE FOR ADDING TO MY FILE
